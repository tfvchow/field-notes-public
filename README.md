Research notes on dev tooling and infrastructure used across my projects.

Covers troubleshooting, internals analysis, bug reports, and workarounds for tools like:

- **Claude Code** — session management, chain integrity, resume logic
- **claude-mem** — MCP memory server
- **MCP servers** — protocol, integration issues
- **Node.js** — runtime quirks, debugging
- Other stack/tooling issues as they come up

Notes are filed as issues for easy search and cross-referencing.
